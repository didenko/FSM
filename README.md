Finite State Machine
--------------------

This is an FSM template written in C++11 using _MS Visual Studio C++ 2013_. It has an example implementation an a couple tests in the `test` subdirectory. Tests are specific to _Visual Studio_ framework, bit example implementation is not - should build in any environment.

To load the code in _Visual Studio_, double click on the `fsm.sln` file. The project has only `Debug | x64` configuration. Before running tests, make sure that _X64_ architecture is selected at the menu `TEST` > `Test Settings` > `Default Processor Architecture` > `X64`. Then you can build and run tests (`Ctrl+R`, `A` key sequence).
